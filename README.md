# Public Interest Technology Workgroup
*This repository is for Public Interest Technology Fellows Steering Committee to organize related events*

Ford Foundation, Mozilla Foundation and Media Democracy Fund (MDF) are keen to provide more support and opportunities for collaboration across the global network of Public Interest Technology (PIT) fellows from current and past cohorts across multiple programs.

A steering committee of volunteer past fellows representatives of the organizations involved has been assembled to help drive a program that can do just that. Here is who we are:
    
- Chair: Darius Kazemi, Portland (Mozilla)
- Co-chair: Nasser Eledroos, Boston (MDF) – TBC
- Paulia Bustos Arellano, Mexico City (MDF)
- Jen Kagan, Seattle (MDF)
- Wilneida Negron, New York (Ford)
- Becca Ricks, Cambridge (Mozilla)
- Danielle Robinson, Portland (Mozilla)
- Daniela Saderi, Portland (Mozilla)

To set the groundwork, the committee is organizing the first alum-led gathering of PIT fellow alums at MozFest 2019, which will take place between October 22-29 in London. Currently, we are planning to hold the meeting at the Mozfest House at the Royal Society for the Arts on Wednesday, October 23 from 8am to 5pm – but we are also exploring other availability for meetups throughout the week.

The committee's priority is to ensure participation to this event reflects the diversity of backgourds, cultural and professional of all fellows across programs.

We have $40,000 available to support fellows' attendance to MozFest. To gather interest, we are currently running a [survey](https://forms.gle/WNx1YHdMDtRZWMdB7) that we are distributing across our networks.
